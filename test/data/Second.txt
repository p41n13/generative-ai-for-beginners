216113020-543210 -Printed on acid-free paper Preface 
The publication of Introduction to Robotics is one among the results of many 
years' work by the authors of this book in the study of robotics. During the 
first stage of this work, devoted to locomotion robots and anthropomorphic 
mechanisms in particular, a number of papers were published in the period 
1974-76. The most prominent of them is M. VukobratoviC's Legged Locomotion 
Systems and Anthropomorphic Mechanisms, published in English, Russian, 
Japanese and Chinese. 
The contributions by the associates of the Mibajlo Pupin Institute's Robotics 
Department in the second stage of their work in the field of robotics are 
included in Scientific Fundamentals of Robotics -a series of monograpbs 
covering the study of manipulation robots. Six volumes of this series were 
published in English by Springer-Verlag during 1982-85. Some of these volumes 
were translated into other languages. Volume 1 was translated into Japanese 
and published by Springer-Verlag, Volume 2 was published by Nauka in 
Russian (the translation of Volume 5 into Russian is finished and will be 
published by Mir in 1988), and all six volumes of the series were translated 
into Chinese. The work on writing the series for Springer-Verlag continues. 
The topics treated in the books that have been published by Springer-Verlag 
are as follows. The first in the series provides a study of dynamics and the 
application of dynamic models to the dynamic calculations of robot mechanisms, 
and the second book studies the problems of synthesizing control laws for 
manipulation robots on the basis of their complete dynamic models. Volume 3 
describes efficient methods for forming the kinematic models of manipulation 
robots and the synthesis of robot trajectories in unobstacled and obstacled 
operating environments. Volume 4 deals with the algorithms for efficient 
construction of the mathematical models of robot dynamics, that are suitable 
for use in nonadaptive and adaptive control of robot mechanisms as well as 
the analysis of the numerical complexity of various control laws intended to 
permit their microcomputer implementation. Volume 5 treats the synthesis 
of nonadaptive and adaptive control and the analysis of the numerical com­
plexity of various control laws. Volume 6 outlines the convenience of using 
the mathematical models of manipulation robot dynamics in choosing different 
types of robot actuators, and the results concerning some specific manipulation 
tasks in which dynamic reactions occur on a robot gripper. VI Preface 
The books described above and work published by an increasing number 
of other authors represent adequate introduction for postgraduate robotics 
courses. However, it has also been necessary to create textbook material 
suitable for the basic robotics courses of undergraduate studies at engineering 
faculties. Such literature on robotics is lacking both in quantity and appropriate 
presentation. In addition to textbooks, books on robotics that introduce readers 
in a more easily understandable way to this important and propulsive field 
of technical science appear to be lacking as well. 
In writing a book intended to introduce a technically qualified reader to the 
field of robotics, the authors are always faced with the risk of either over­
simplifying the subject matter or providing just a condensed version of the text 
of a previously published monograph. 
The authors of this book have attempted to present the relatively wide scope 
of robotics subject matter in a different way. Their intention has been to 
discuss all the details of robotics in such a manner as to arouse interest to 
this research area without facing the reader with serious difficulties in following 
the text, from the standpoints of classical mechanics, systems theory and 
computer engineering. We think that we have attained this aim which makes 
the whole text easy to follow by final-year students in mechanical and electrical 
engineering faculties as well as by students of science and mathematics spe­
cializing in mechanics, mathematics and physics, with some basic knowledge 
of automatic control theory. 
The authors of this text, and of the chapter on robot dynamics in particular, 
were in a dilemma as to how to present this subject because of its exceptional 
importance in robotics and its role in the control and modern dynamic analysis 
of robot mechanisms. It is well known that more than fifteen years ago, within the 
Belgrade school of robotics some of the authors of this book were among the first 
in the world to lay the foundations of computer-oriented methods for con­
structing the dynamic equations of active spatial mechanisms. But, because of the 
character of this book and space limitations, there was some fear, that the 
automated algorithm for forming dynamic robot models could be presented in 
a way understandable to readers who are making their first steps in robotic 
studies. However, consistent with our opinion that the "manual" construction of 
robot models is now an anachronism and accepting a certain amount of risk, we 
decided to take this contemporary approach to the study of robot dynamics. 
This book is organized into nine chapters. 
Chapter 1 presents general robot characteristics concerning the classification 
of robot systems, the general specification of robot mechanisms and the 
specification of manipulation robots. 
Chapter 2 is devoted to manipulation robot kinematics. It treats the kinematic 
structure of manipulation robots, the types of kinematic configurations, the 
kinematic model of manipulation robots, based on the Denavit-Hartenberg 
(homogeneous) coordinates. The inverse problem of kinematics is formulated 
and the basic principles of robot trajectory synthesis are given. Preface VII 
Chapter 3 contains the fundamentals of studying robot dynamics. It presents 
the automated construction of the dynamic equations of motion, the modelling 
of actuator dynamics and the effect of fundamental vibration on the robot 
dynamics. The class of tasks involving constrained gripper motion is also 
presented. 
The problems of manipulation robot control are discussed in Chapter 4. 
Particular attention is given to the synthesis of programmed control based 
on the complete or partial dynamic models of robots and to the synthesis 
of local controllers. Some results relating to load feedback are presented 
and the control problem of automated mechanical assembly is considered. 
Chapter 5 is devoted to the microcomputer implementation of control 
algorithms. It presents the basic elements of today's robot control systems as 
well as software modules among which communication-command module, 
kinematic module and dynamic (servosystem) module deserve to be especially 
mentioned. 
Manipulation robot programming is treated in Chapter 6. Apart from mani­
pulator motion programming, special attention is devoted to robot communi­
cation with the environment and to a short survey of programming methods. 
Chapter 7 deals with the sensors used in robotics: position sensors (potentio­
meters, encoders, resolvers), environment sensors (force sensors, tactile 
sensors, proximity sensors) and vision sensors (scene illumination, special 
vision sensors, lasers). 
The elements of industrial robot design and application are discussed in 
Chapter 8. Some specificfeatures of industrial robots as mechanical constructions 
are presented, design solutions for the basic modules are described and numerous 
examples illustrating the practical application of industrial robots are given (spot 
and arc welding, die-casting, forging, painting, machine tool serving, etc.). 
Considerable research and development work has been performed on flexible 
automation systems. In Chapter 9 we have tried to unify in a systematic way 
major problems (and possible solutions) encountered with factory automation 
by integrating one or more robots and several machine tools into work cell, 
flexible manufacturing line and assembly systems. 
The authors of this book have tried to present the text in such a way as will 
arouse the interest of all those who wish to have a solid background for 
systematic robotic studies.
